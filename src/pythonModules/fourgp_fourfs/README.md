# fourgp_fourfs

This python package provides a wrapper for functions provided by the 4MOST Facility Simulator, 4FS.

It requires the 4FS code to have been downloaded and compiled, and provides functions for degrading high-resolution spectra to the resolution and signal-to-noise ratios expected from 4MOST.
