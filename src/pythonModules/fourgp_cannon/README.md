# fourgp_cannon

This package provides a simple wrapper for passing spectra in SpectrumLibraries to the Cannon.

It requires that you have installed Annie's Lasso in the python virtual environment you are using.

At the time of writing their are various branches of Annie's Lasso with different APIs. The following branch uses Andy Casey's latest development API, which is the one 4GP expects:

```
git checkout https://github.com/dcf21/AnniesLasso.git develop
cd AnniesLasso
python setup.py install
```
